- 👋 Hi, my name is Logan Fry
- 👀 I’m interested in developing a broad programming skillset, with special interest in data gathering and interpretation. I am also fond of binary specifications (see "PNG Interpreter").
- 🌱 I’m currently learning requisite python packages and algorithms + data processing/visualizing (MatPlotLib, NUMPY, PANDAS), Django, and ASYNCIO
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects
- 📫 Contact me: loganfrybusiness(at)gmail(dot)com
